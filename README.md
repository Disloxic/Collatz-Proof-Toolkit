# Collatz-Proof-Toolkit
The Sextant Matrix System: A novel framework that organizes the set of positive odd integers Z^+_{odd} into an Infinite Radial Lattice of six angular sectors. We fully resolve the Collatz Conjecture by mapping the arithmetic flow of the Collatz map onto a rigid geometric coordinate system. Every trajectory is structurally forced to the root.
